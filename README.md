# Visual-Recognition

Welcome to the Visual Recognition project repository!

## Overview

This project focuses on two main objectives:

1. **Identity Recognition**: Developed a model for identifying a person's identity based on their image.
2. **Food Recognition**: Developed a model for detecting the constituents of a dish to calculate the carbon footprint.

## Project Details

- **Identity Recognition**:
  - Utilized deep learning techniques to create a model capable of accurately identifying individuals from images.
  - Explored various neural network architectures and optimization strategies to achieve high accuracy.

- **Food Recognition**:
  - Developed a model to recognize the constituents of a dish from images.
  - Implemented algorithms to estimate the carbon footprint based on the detected ingredients.

## Collaboration
